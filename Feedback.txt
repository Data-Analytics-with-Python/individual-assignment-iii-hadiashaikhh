 One-hot encoding not applied through a full ColumnTransformer; categorical variables were manually encoded and then passed into a pipeline with only a regressor: -3.
Metrics computed correctly, but explanation is very minimal: -1,
CV executed correctly, but no meaningful interpretation included: -1,
Best params printed, but scoring and model retrieval incomplete: -2
Question 2: Very limited comparison/interpretation: -2
Question 3: KNN pipeline incomplete: categorical preprocessing missing; numeric scaling missing: -4,
Accuracy evaluated but missing classification report + required 7-metric interpretation: -4
Total: 79/100
